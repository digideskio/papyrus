Using phantomjs
===============

Currently (status: 20151010) generating screenshots using `phantomjs <http://phantomjs.org/>`_ works, but is not standardly enabled.

- for now, it is only tested against phantomjs 1.9.8, as there are build issues with 2.0 on Linux and OSX Yosemite
- installing phantomjs is either platform-dependent, or uses an extra software stack (npm), so adds to the difficulty of getting papyrus to run

So for now, it is only optional, and you will have to install phantomjs using your own OS or npm toolchain.

The default remains to use Firefox.
